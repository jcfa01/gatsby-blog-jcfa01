So, I have done the basics of jQuery. the syntax, event handlers, common effects and animations, and some UI. in order for me to adjust my advanced percentage, I must apply it in my working test project or tutorial stage project. and for the expert I must apply it on my dream project. for now that is what I called it because I haven’t done anything to it. and in order for me to start on that, I have to learn all of the basics of full-stack web development. so far I’m making slow progress because of my other ventures. I hope I do less and less of it. I still haven’t done my nodejs and mongoDB connection. and that’s my agenda for tommorrow. I hope there will be progress by then. for now. I’m done with jQuery “Basics!”.it.
