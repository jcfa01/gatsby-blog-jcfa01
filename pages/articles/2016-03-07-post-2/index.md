one word. hard. I know it will be. but I didn’t expect that I will be stuck on this one, I mean I’m only at the beginning. connecting the dots. connecting the database to node.js. error 404. that’s I’m getting. I’m stuck because I’m not that focused today at learning. well because I’m binge watching house of cards. haha. I have to say it. so I will remember why I take to long to learn this simply task. then let me change that one word .procrastination. yeah. I’m a master at that one. beyond godlike at doing that. well. I hope in this next few days I get the hang of it. I did learn something today so. it’s not that bad. I learned the basic commands in mongo shell. I inserted data in the database. the problem is. I can’t seems to output it on the browser. I’m trying the mongoimport the first time. but then I just have a few data so I just use the insert(). I find a cool website to make mock data. mockaroo.com. it will become useful if I need a large data testing. so that’s it. I hope I accomplish something tomorrow or after I finish season 4. haha.
