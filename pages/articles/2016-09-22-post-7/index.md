This isn’t relate to programming but I think it’s a life lesson for me to be better at my career. Yesterday I apply for a job and I failed horribly, I really wanted that job, and I wasn’t expecting to fail to the exam and I didn’t even  get to be interviewed,  I usually fail at HR interview, exams suppose to be my strong suit well now I guess not, not anymore really, I’m rusty, it’s time to admit that. Well better start to clean up my act, focused on things that’s needed attention. better reduce my procrastination or completely obliterate it, it’s not going to be easy though but it’s better to try to or else I’ll just become an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone.
