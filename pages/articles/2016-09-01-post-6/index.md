Over the past few months I admit, I haven’t focused on coding still, but more and more I’m making it a habit, everyday I code, everyday I finish coding exercises and challenges on FreeCodeCamp. Previously I have done coding exercises on CodeCademy but I’m almost done on the courses there so I switch to FreeCodeCamp. I have finished the introductory courses on react on CodeCademy and it was the bomb, it was awesome, I hope they’ll create more courses on react soon. Right now I’m working on intermediate front end development  projects on FreeCodeCamp and I’m kinda stuck in it, hopefully I can do all of it this week so I can do the intermediate algorithm scripting, the basic algorithm was tough but it was fun can’t wait for the intermediate. I’ll try to write more logs now to see my progress more clearly and it keeps me motivated to see how far I have come and far still more to learn. I’m finding a job soon I hope I found one where I could be a front end developer.
