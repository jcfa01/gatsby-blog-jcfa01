First of all sorry for my bad English, I’m just typing random thoughts. this blog is my progress log of what I’ve learned. this is intended as a reminder for me but if you ever across of reading this blogs you are free to do so. so far I’ve learned html, css, JavaScript and 60% on jQuery. at the same time I’m learning node.js, express.js and mongoDB. I’m just at the beginning at this point.learning the basics. then I want to learn React.js after I learned the basics. I want to be a full-stack web developer. and by doing that. first I want to be familiarizes with the front-end stuff then I will be doing the back-end so that it for the first post. hope I do all this with great passion.
