Itâ€™s been awhile since I havenâ€™t post a log, been busy, been confused of what to focus on about things. but now itâ€™s clear, Iâ€™m blogging so that I can see my progress. so far not so good, Iâ€™m far behind way behind, but I hope I can really keep it up this time, today I did a review on HTML & CSS plus Bootstrap, I wanted to learn foundation though. donâ€™t know switch is better. thanks to freecodecamp.com, I can see my progress clearly. so no new learned things for now, just a review, next stop, jQuery and still a review and also almost forgot python! Iâ€™m learning python but on the early stages itâ€™s a cool language Iâ€™m trying to learn almost every computer language thatâ€™s being use today itâ€™s good to be versatile web developer this days in my opinion, and by the way Iâ€™m learning touch typing not to late to learn that, not related to programming but surely will help typing codes haha, and this web logs it help me write and correct my grammar so cool cool cool coolðŸ˜€. hope to be more productive in the near future.
